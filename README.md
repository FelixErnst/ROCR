## Installation of ROCR

The most straightforward way to install and use `ROCR` is to install it from 
`CRAN` by starting `R` and using the `install.packages` function:

```
install.packages("ROCR")
```

Alternatively you can install it from command line using the tar ball like this:

```
R CMD INSTALL ROCR_*.tar.gz
```

Have fun!


## Getting started with ROCR:

* After installation, and starting R, load the package with `library(ROCR)`.
